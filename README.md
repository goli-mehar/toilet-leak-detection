# toilet-leak-detection
Toilet leaks can often be costly financially and environmentally due to the water wastage they incur, and while solvable there is yet to exist an efficient method to quickly notify an owner of any leaks. In the current system, leaks often persist for months - often becoming apparent due to irregular increases in the water bill. Thus, the project intends to build a device such that it will quickly notify an owner of a toilet leak. A window sensor and an arduino based interface are utilized to create the device, with a computer program to run the device and then utilize IFTTT to notify the homeowner of the leak. During experimentation, water sensors were found to be more efficient and were thus incorporated, in addition, a speaker was added to notify the owner audibly. For further research, the device may be modified to work with pipes as well as be extended to work with multiple toilets or even be connected to the home security system.
